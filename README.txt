Arduino Keyboard Pimp

My favourite keyboard is the Cherry G80-3000 mechanical keyboard, but I aim to add additional functions to the device.  On the list is a password manager controlled by RFID.

This project I aim to achieve by using the Arduino Leonardo (well an AVR development board loaded with the Leonardo bootloader).

The project is in it's infancy just now.  It is designed to compile in the Arduino 1.0 environment.  Currently in order to compile for the Leonardo you have to enable it within the arduino-1.0\hardware\arduino\boards.txt file.  

Pinouts and more project details will be added to www.justblair.co.uk as they are finalised.
